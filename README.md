### Hey! I'm Matt (he/him), a 3rd-year CS student at UC Irvine. 🌟

I love creating and exploring—anything from *3D modeling* to *astrophotography* to *programming*. I have recently been learning more about how to integrate my creative and technical passions with *video games* and *digital design*.

If you're interested in viewing any of my art and design projects or getting in touch, feel free to check out [my website](http://www.matthewgies.com)!
