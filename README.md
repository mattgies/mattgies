### Hey! I'm Matt (he/him), a 3rd-year CS student at UC Irvine.

I love creatingâ€”anything from 3D modeling to painting to programming. I have recently been working on coding my own portfolio and learning more about how to integrate my creative and technical passions with video games and digital design. If you're interested in viewing any of my art and design projects or getting in touch, feel free to check out [my website](matthewgies.com)!
